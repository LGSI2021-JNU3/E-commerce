# E-commerce

Create a simple e-commerce website (static webpage). It should have a login page, item page, and buy page. After login it should show at least 15 items, you should display item name and add relevant image of the item. It should have an option to rate and also a button you can add to the cart (i.e. navigating that item to the next page and seeing the details). After completing it first verify it in the browser and then execute it in the WebOS apps.
